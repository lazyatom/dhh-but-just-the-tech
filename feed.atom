    <summary>&lt;div class=&quot;trix-content&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;We&#39;re going all-in on &lt;a href=&quot;https://omarchy.org&quot;&gt;Omarchy&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=&quot;https://37signals.com/&quot;&gt;37signals&lt;/a&gt;. Over the next three years, as the regular churn of hardware invites it, we&#39;re switching everyone on our Ops and Ruby programming teams to our own Arch-derived Linux distribution (and of course sharing all the improvements we make along the way with everyone else on Omarchy!).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;It&#39;s funny how nobody bats an eye when the company mandate is to use Macs or Windows, but when the prescription is Linux, it&#39;s suddenly surprising. It really shouldn&#39;t be. Your ability to control your own destiny with Linux is far superior to what you&#39;ll get from a closed-source, commercial operating system. Of course it is! The code is literally all there!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;True, you might face more challenges, and there won&#39;t be a vendor to call (unless you hop into the Enterprise Linux camp, which doesn&#39;t appeal to me either). But I&#39;ve never given a damn about that. I started using Ruby to build Basecamp when we could barely fill a room in American with professional Ruby programmers. This is what we do here!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;This also means giving up on MacBooks and choosing &lt;a href=&quot;https://frame.work/laptop13&quot;&gt;Framework laptops&lt;/a&gt; as the new standard-issue equipment. Along with desktop machines &lt;a href=&quot;https://frame.work/desktop&quot;&gt;from Framework&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bee-link.com/&quot;&gt;Beelink&lt;/a&gt; both. PC hardware &lt;a href=&quot;https://world.hey.com/dhh/cheap-mini-pcs-have-gotten-really-good-c70ab40f&quot;&gt;has gotten incredibly good&lt;/a&gt; over the last few years, as &lt;a href=&quot;https://world.hey.com/dhh/amd-in-everything-0ec0cc6e&quot;&gt;AMD in particular&lt;/a&gt; has managed to extract many of the same processor improvements from TSMC, as Apple did so well with the M series. At least in terms of performance.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Again, true, there is still a gap on the efficiency front. Nobody can currently beat Apple on the wattage-to-power ratio (but the gap is fast closing!). So battery life on Linux using Framework is currently a bit less. I get about 6 hours of mixed use from my Framework 13, so whenever I suspect that might be a problem, I bring a small &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Portable-Charger-TSA-Approved-Digital-Display/dp/B0BYNZXFM2&quot;&gt;20K mAh Anker battery&lt;/a&gt; in the bag, and now I have double the capacity.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;A small concession on a rare occasion, but nothing like the performance AND battery deficit we willingly endured for decades on the Mac before Apple switched to their own chips. Because we wanted to run OSX. It was worth sacrifice a few other concerns for. Just like Linux is today.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;On the flip side, we&#39;ll get a massive boost in productivity from being able to run our Ruby on Rails test suites locally much faster. For our HEY application, even the fastest Mac, an M4 Max, is &lt;a href=&quot;https://world.hey.com/dhh/the-framework-desktop-is-a-beast-636fb4ff&quot;&gt;almost twice as slow as a Framework Desktop machine running Linux&lt;/a&gt;, which can do Docker natively.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;It&#39;s an exciting new adventure for us. Omarchy is already by far-and-away my favorite computing environment. Right up there in joy and wonder with the old Amiga days or early OSX. It&#39;s been a blast learning that so many other early-adopters have found the same feeling. Very reminiscent of the excitement in the early Ruby days. Knowing you&#39;d found something super special that wasn&#39;t yet widely distributed (but poised to be).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I spoke about all of this with Kimberly on &lt;a href=&quot;https://37signals.com/podcast/moving-to-omarchy/&quot;&gt;a bonus episode of The REWORK Podcast&lt;/a&gt;. Give it a listen if you&#39;re curious about the why, the how, and the inevitable objections.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &lt;figure class=&quot;attachment attachment--preview attachment--lightboxable attachment--png&quot;&gt;

    <summary>&lt;div class=&quot;trix-content&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;I&#39;ve been running the &lt;a href=&quot;https://frame.work/desktop&quot;&gt;Framework Desktop&lt;/a&gt; for a few months here in Copenhagen now. It&#39;s an incredible machine. It&#39;s completely quiet, even under heavy, stress-all-cores load. It&#39;s tiny too, at just 4.5L of volume, especially compared to my old beautiful but bulky North tower running the 7950X — yet it&#39;s faster! And finally, it&#39;s simply funky, quirky, and fun!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In some ways, the Framework Desktop is a curious machine. Desktop PCs are already very user-repairable! So why is Framework even bringing their talents to this domain? In the laptop realm, they&#39;re basically alone with that concept, but in the desktop space, it&#39;s rather crowded already. Yet it somehow still makes sense.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Partly because Framework has gone with the AMD Ryzen AI Max 395+, which is technically a laptop CPU. You can find it in the ASUS ROG Flow Z13 and the HP ZBook Ultra. Which means it&#39;ll fit in a tiny footprint, and Framework apparently just wanted to see what they could do in that form factor. They clearly had fun with it. Look at mine:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &lt;figure class=&quot;attachment attachment--preview attachment--lightboxable attachment--jpg&quot;&gt;

        &lt;img src=&quot;https://world.hey.com/dhh/636fb4ff/representations/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MjIxODcxMTQ2NywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ--37468cffd0c8dfd243eff24a502df2b9c6f95301603e601a355dfa7a89cc1a61/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6eyJmb3JtYXQiOiJqcGciLCJyZXNpemVfdG9fbGltaXQiOlszODQwLDI1NjBdLCJxdWFsaXR5Ijo2MCwibG9hZGVyIjp7InBhZ2UiOm51bGx9LCJjb2FsZXNjZSI6dHJ1ZX0sInB1ciI6InZhcmlhdGlvbiJ9fQ--b3779d742b3242a2a5284869a45b2a113e0c177f0450c29f0baca1ee780f6604/framework-desktop.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;framework-desktop.jpg&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are 21 little tiles on the front that you can get in a bunch of different colors or with logos from Framework. Or you can 3D print your own! It&#39;s a welcome change in aesthetic from the brushed aluminum or gamer-focused RGBs approach that most of the competition is taking.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But let&#39;s cut to the benchmarks. That&#39;s really why you&#39;d buy a machine like the Framework Desktop. There are significantly cheaper mini PCs available from Beelink and others, but so far, Framework has the only AMD 395+ unit on sale that&#39;s completely silent (the GMKTec very much is not, nor is the Z3 Flow). And for me, that&#39;s just a dealbreaker. I can&#39;t listen to roaring fans anymore.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here&#39;s the key benchmark for me:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &lt;figure class=&quot;attachment attachment--preview attachment--lightboxable attachment--png&quot;&gt;
      &lt;a download=&quot;image.png&quot; title=&quot;Download image.png&quot; data-click-proxy-target=&quot;lightbox_link_blob_2218713427&quot; href=&quot;https://world.hey.com/dhh/636fb4ff/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MjIxODcxMzQyNywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ--5c63eaa28ceb3256f4d22364529154252dc2e27bfca899bacbfa968c284a50a4/image.png?disposition=attachment&quot;&gt;
        &lt;img src=&quot;https://world.hey.com/dhh/636fb4ff/representations/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MjIxODcxMzQyNywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ--5c63eaa28ceb3256f4d22364529154252dc2e27bfca899bacbfa968c284a50a4/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6eyJmb3JtYXQiOiJwbmciLCJyZXNpemVfdG9fbGltaXQiOlszODQwLDI1NjBdLCJxdWFsaXR5Ijo2MCwibG9hZGVyIjp7InBhZ2UiOm51bGx9LCJjb2FsZXNjZSI6dHJ1ZX0sInB1ciI6InZhcmlhdGlvbiJ9fQ--7edc7b21f6fad97fa22412618822c4d19725431f296c7ce47dc174b61535d27c/image.png&quot; alt=&quot;image.png&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That&#39;s the only type of multi-core workload I really sit around waiting on these days, and the Framework Desktop absolutely crushes it. It&#39;s almost twice as fast as the Beelink SER8 and still a solid third faster than the Beelink SER9 too. Of course, it&#39;s also a lot more expensive, but you&#39;re clearly getting some multi-core bang for your buck here!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It&#39;s even a more dramatic difference to the Macs. It&#39;s a solid 40% faster than the M4 Max and 50% faster than the M4 Pro! Now some will say &quot;that&#39;s just because Docker is faster on Linux,&quot; and they&#39;re not entirely wrong. Docker runs natively on Linux, so for this test, where the MySQL/Redis/ElasticSearch data stores run in Docker while Ruby and the app code runs natively, that&#39;s part of the answer. Last I checked, it was about 25% of the difference.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But so what? Docker is an integral part of the workflow for tons of developers. We use it to be able to run different versions of MySQL, Redis, and ElasticSearch for different applications on the same machine at the same time. You can&#39;t really do that without Docker. So this is what Real World benchmarks reveal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It&#39;s not just about having a Docker advantage, though. The AMD 395+ is also incredibly potent in RAW CPU performance. Those 16 Zen5 cores are running at 5.1GHz, and in Geekbench 6 multicore, this is how they stack up:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &lt;figure class=&quot;attachment attachment--preview attachment--lightboxable attachment--png&quot;&gt;
      &lt;a download=&quot;image.png&quot; title=&quot;Download image.png&quot; data-click-proxy-target=&quot;lightbox_link_blob_2218715334&quot; href=&quot;https://world.hey.com/dhh/636fb4ff/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MjIxODcxNTMzNCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ--245e487838b293d7e29a2be7b1fe899f629e79484e218b23c8b6f48b30ba5eb4/image.png?disposition=attachment&quot;&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Basically matching the M4 Max! And a good chunk faster than the M4 Pro (as well as other AMDs and Intel&#39;s 14900K!). No wonder that it&#39;s crazy quick with a full-core stress test like running 30,000 assertions for our &lt;a href=&quot;https://hey.com/&quot;&gt;HEY&lt;/a&gt; test suite.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To be fair, the M4s are faster in single-core performance. Apple holds the crown there. It&#39;s about 20%. And you&#39;ll see that in benchmarks like Speedometer, which mostly measures JavaScript single-core performance. The Framework Desktop puts out 670 vs 744 on the M4 Pro on Speedometer 2.1. On SP 3.1, it&#39;s an even bigger difference with 35 vs 50.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &lt;figure class=&quot;attachment attachment--preview attachment--lightboxable attachment--png&quot;&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But I&#39;ve found that all these computers feel fast enough in single-core performance these days. I can&#39;t actually feel the difference browsing on a machine that does 670 vs 744 on SP2.1. Hell, I can barely feel the difference between the SER8, which does 506, and the M4 Pro! The only time I actually feel like I&#39;m waiting on anything is in multi-core workloads like the HEY test suite, and here the AMD 395+ is very near the fastest you can get for a consumer desktop machine today at any price.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It gets even better when you bring price into the equation, though. The Framework Desktop with 64GB RAM + 2TB NVMe is $1,876. To get a Mac Studio with similar specs — M4 Max, 64GB RAM, 2TB NVMe — you&#39;ll literally spend nearly twice as much at $3,299! If you go for 128GB RAM, you&#39;ll spend $2,276 on the Framework, but $4,099 on the Mac. And it&#39;ll still be way slower for development work using Docker! The Framework Desktop is simply a great deal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Speaking of 64GB vs 128GB, I&#39;ve been running the 64GB version, and I almost never get anywhere close to the limits. I think the highest I&#39;ve seen in regular use is about 20GB of RAM in action. Linux is really efficient. Especially when you&#39;re using a window manager like Hyprland, as we do in Omarchy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The only reason you really want to go for the full 128GB RAM is to run local LLM models. The AMD 395+ uses unified memory, like Apple, so nearly all of it is addressable to be used by the GPU. That means you can run monster models, like the new 120b gpt-oss from OpenAI. Framework has a &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/FrameworkPuter/status/1952854105606766922&quot;&gt;video showing them pushing out 40 tokens/second&lt;/a&gt; doing just that. That seems about in range of the numbers I&#39;ve seen from the M4 Max, which also seem in the 40-50 token/second range, but I&#39;ll defer to folks who benchmark local LLMs for the exact details on that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I tried running the new gpt-oss-20b on my 64GB machine, though, and I wasn&#39;t exactly blown away by the accuracy. In fact, I&#39;d say it was pretty bad. I mean, exceptionally cool that it&#39;s doable, but very far off the frontier models we have access to as SaaS. So personally, this isn&#39;t yet something I actually use all that much in day-to-day development. I want the best models running at full speed, and right now that means SaaS.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So if you just want the best, small computer that runs Linux superbly well out of the box, you should buy the Framework Desktop. It&#39;s completely quiet, fantastically fast, and super fun to look at.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But I think it&#39;s also fair to mention that you can get something like &lt;a href=&quot;https://world.hey.com/dhh/it-s-a-beelink-baby-243fdaf1&quot;&gt;a Beelink SER9 for half the price&lt;/a&gt;! Yes, it&#39;s also only 2/3 the performance in multi-core, but it&#39;s just as fast in single-core. Most developers could totally get away with the SER9, and barely notice what they were missing. But there are just as many people for whom the extra $1,000 is worth the price to run the test suite 40 seconds quicker! You know who you are.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Oh, before I close, I also need to mention that this thing is a gaming powerhouse. It basically punches about as hard as an RTX 4060! With an iGPU! That&#39;s kinda crazy. Totally new territory on the PC side for integrated graphics. ETA Prime has a video showing the same chip in the GMK Tech &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGKvUahL-_I&amp;amp;t=551s&quot;&gt;running premier games at 1440p High Settings at great frame rates&lt;/a&gt;. You can run most games under Linux these days too (thanks Valve and Steam Deck!), but if you need to dual boot with Windows, the dual NVMe slots in the Framework Desktop come very handy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Framework did good with this one. AMD really blew it out of the water with the 395+. We&#39;re spoiled to have such incredible hardware available for Linux at such appealing discounts over similar stuff from Cupertino. What a great time to love open source software and tinker-friendly hardware!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;div&gt;I often give Google a lot of shit for &lt;a href=&quot;https://killedbygoogle.com/&quot;&gt;shutting down services&lt;/a&gt; whenever they&#39;re bored, hire a new executive, or face a three-day weekend. The company seems institutionally incapable of standing behind the majority of the products they launch for longer than a KPI cycle. But when the company &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; decide that something is pivotal to the business, it&#39;s an entirely different story. And that&#39;s the tale of YouTube: The King of Internet Archives (Video Edition).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&#39;ve just &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/@dhh37&quot;&gt;revived my YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt; after realizing just how often video has become my go-to for learning. This &lt;a href=&quot;https://world.hey.com/dhh/omarchy-is-on-the-move-8f848fa4&quot;&gt;entire&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://world.hey.com/dhh/omarchy-is-out-4666dd31&quot;&gt;Linux&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://world.hey.com/dhh/introducing-omakub-354db366&quot;&gt;adventure&lt;/a&gt; I&#39;ve gotten myself into started by watching YouTube creators like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/@ThePrimeTimeagen&quot;&gt;ThePrimeagen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/@typecraft_dev&quot;&gt;Typecraft&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/@BreadOnPenguins&quot;&gt;Bread on Penguins&lt;/a&gt;. I learned about mechanical keyboards from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/@HipyoTech&quot;&gt;Hipyo Tech&lt;/a&gt;. Devoured endless mini PC reviews from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/c/Level1Techs&quot;&gt;Level1Techs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/@Robtech&quot;&gt;Robtech&lt;/a&gt;. Oh, and took a side quest into retro gaming handhelds with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/@RetroGameCorps&quot;&gt;Retro Game Corps&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But it was when putting together the playlists for my own channel that YouTube&#39;s royal role in internet archival really stood out. Like with &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/Gzj723LkRJY?feature=shared&quot;&gt;the original Rails Demo from 19 years ago&lt;/a&gt;(!), &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CDXJ6bMkMY&quot;&gt;the infamous talk at Startup School from 2009&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFhoSMD6idk&amp;amp;list=PL3m89j0mV0pfIEdg2fnwRf6Dkqr3xUd3L&amp;amp;index=16&quot;&gt;my very first RailsConf keynote from 2006&lt;/a&gt;. You&#39;d be hard-pressed to find any video content on the internet from those days anywhere else. I notice that with podcast appearances from even just a few years ago that have gone missing already. Decentralization is wonderful in many ways, but it&#39;s very much subject to link rot and disappearing content.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I love how you can pull in videos from other channels onto your own page as well. I&#39;ve gathered up a bunch of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3m89j0mV0peRhnSw1Gyi9mkMDEpZNsrn&quot;&gt;the many podcast appearances I&#39;ve done&lt;/a&gt;, and even dedicated an entire playlist to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3m89j0mV0pcb58xIf8LimphGrCHVwNSf&quot;&gt;69(!!) clips from the Lex Fridman interview&lt;/a&gt;. The majority of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3m89j0mV0pfIEdg2fnwRf6Dkqr3xUd3L&quot;&gt;the RailsConf and Rails World keynotes are on a list&lt;/a&gt;. So is the old &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3m89j0mV0pdNAg6x9oq6S8Qz_4C-yuwj&quot;&gt;On Writing Software Well&lt;/a&gt; series that I keep meaning to bring back.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When you&#39;re working in small tech, it&#39;s really easy to become so jaded with big tech that you become ideologically blind to the benefits they do bring. I find no inconsistency in cheering much of the antitrust agenda against Google while also &lt;a href=&quot;https://world.hey.com/dhh/don-t-make-google-sell-chrome-93cefbc6&quot;&gt;celebrating their work on Chrome&lt;/a&gt; or their stewardship of YouTube. Any company as large as Google is bound to be full of contradictions, ambitions, and behaviors. We ought to have the capacity to cheer for the good parts and boo at the bad parts without feeling like frauds.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So today, I choose to cheer for YouTube. It&#39;s an international treasure of learning, enthusiasm, and discovery.&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://omarchy.org/&quot;&gt;Omarchy&lt;/a&gt; has been improving at a furious pace. Since it was &lt;a href=&quot;https://world.hey.com/dhh/omarchy-is-out-4666dd31&quot;&gt;first released on June 26&lt;/a&gt;, I&#39;ve pushed out &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/basecamp/omarchy/releases&quot;&gt;18(!) new releases&lt;/a&gt; together with a rapidly growing community of collaborators, users, and new-to-Linux enthusiasts. We have about 3,500 early adopters on &lt;a href=&quot;https://discord.gg/tXFUdasqhY&quot;&gt;the Omarchy Discord&lt;/a&gt;, 250 pull requests processed, and one heck of an awesome &lt;a href=&quot;https://archlinux.org/&quot;&gt;Arch&lt;/a&gt; + &lt;a href=&quot;https://hypr.land/&quot;&gt;Hyprland&lt;/a&gt; Linux environment to show for it!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The latest release is 1.11.0, and it brings &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cft6mZDzIng&quot;&gt;an entirely overhauled control menu&lt;/a&gt; to the experience. Now everything is controlled through a single, unified system that makes it super fast to operate Omarchy&#39;s settings and options through the keyboard. It&#39;s exactly the kind of hands-off-the-mouse operation that I&#39;ve always wanted, and with Linux, I&#39;ve been able to build it just to my tastes. It&#39;s a delight.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;There&#39;s really something special going on in Linux at the moment. Arch has been around for twenty years, but with Hyprland on top, it&#39;s been catapulted in front of an entirely new audience. Folks who&#39;d never thought that open source could be able to deliver a desktop experience &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/search?q=omarchy&amp;amp;src=typed_query&quot;&gt;worth giving up Windows or macOS for&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;Of course, Linux isn&#39;t for everyone. It&#39;s still an adventure! An awesome, teach-you-about-computers adventure, but not everyone is into computer adventures. Plenty of people are content with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5BLs51yDQ&amp;amp;t=52s&quot;&gt;a computer appliance&lt;/a&gt; where they never have to look under the hood. All good. Microsoft and Apple have those people covered.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;But the world is a big place! And in that big place, there are a growing number of computer enthusiasts who&#39;ve grown very disillusioned with both Microsoft and Apple. Folks who could be enticed to give Linux a look, if the barrier was a little lower and the benefits a little clearer. Those are the folks I&#39;m building Omarchy for.&lt;/div&gt;

    <summary>&lt;div class=&quot;trix-content&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;It&#39;s only been two months since I discovered &lt;a href=&quot;https://world.hey.com/dhh/cheap-mini-pcs-have-gotten-really-good-c70ab40f&quot;&gt;the power and joy of this new generation of mini PCs&lt;/a&gt;. My journey started out with a Minisforum UM870, which is a lovely machine, but since then, I&#39;ve come to really appreciate the work of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bee-link.com/&quot;&gt;Beelink&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;In a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gmktec.com/&quot;&gt;crowded&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.minisforum.com/&quot;&gt;market&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.geekompc.com/&quot;&gt;for&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.asus.com/us/displays-desktops/nucs/all-series/&quot;&gt;mini&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://us-store.msi.com/cubi-series&quot;&gt;PCs&lt;/a&gt;, Beelink stands out with their superior build quality, their class-leading cooling and silent operation, and their use of fully Linux-compatible components (the UM870 shipped with a MediaTek bluetooth/wifi card that doesn&#39;t work with Linux!). It&#39;s the complete package at three super compelling price points.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;For $289, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bee-link.com/products/beelink-eqr5?variant=46994723242226&quot;&gt;you can get the EQR5&lt;/a&gt;, which runs an 8-core AMD Zen3 5825U that puts out 1723/6419 in Geekbench, and comes with 16GB RAM and 500GB NVMe. I&#39;ve run &lt;a href=&quot;https://omarchy.org/&quot;&gt;Omarchy&lt;/a&gt; on it, and it flies. For me, the main drawback was the lack of a DisplayPort, which kept me from using it with an Apple display, and the fact that the SER8 exists. But if you&#39;re on a budget, and you&#39;re fine with HDMI only, it&#39;s a wild bargain.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;For $499, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bee-link.com/products/beelink-ser8-8745hs?variant=46991244722418&quot;&gt;you can get the SER8&lt;/a&gt;. That&#39;s the price-to-performance sweet spot in the range. It uses the excellent 8-core AMD Zen4 8745HS that puts out 2595/12985 in Geekbench (~M4 multi-core numbers!), and runs our HEY test suite with 30,000 assertions almost as fast as an M4 Max! At that price, you get 32GB RAM + 1TB NVMe, as well as a DisplayPort, so &lt;a href=&quot;https://manuals.omamix.org/3/omacom/75/apple-displays-on-linux&quot;&gt;it works&lt;/a&gt; with both the Apple 5K Studio Display and the Apple 6K XDR Display (you just need &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BNX7MS6N&quot;&gt;the right cable&lt;/a&gt;). Main drawback is limited wifi/bluetooth range, but Beelink tells me there&#39;s a fix on the way for that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;For $929, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bee-link.com/products/beelink-ser9-ai-9-hx-370&quot;&gt;you can get the SER9 HX370&lt;/a&gt;. This is the top dog in this form factor. It uses the incredible 12-core AMD Zen5 HX370 that hits 2990/15611 in Geekbench, and runs our HEY test suite faster than any Apple M chip I&#39;ve ever tested. The built-in graphics are also very capable. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpsWijbj4U&amp;amp;t=7m10s&quot;&gt;Enough to play a ton of games at 1080p&lt;/a&gt;. It also sorted the SER8&#39;s current wifi/bluetooth range issue.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I ran the SER8 as my main computer for a while, but now I&#39;m using the SER9, and I just about never feel like I need anything more. Yes, the Framework Desktop, with its insane AMD Max 395+ chip, is even more bonkers. It almost cuts the HEY test suite time in half(!), but it&#39;s also $1,795, and not yet generally available. (But &lt;a href=&quot;https://frame.work/desktop&quot;&gt;preorders are open&lt;/a&gt; for the ballers!).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Whichever machine fits your budget, it&#39;s frankly incredible that we have this kind of performance and efficiency available at these prices with all of these Beelinks drawing less than 10 watt at idle and no more than 100 watt at peak!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;So it&#39;s no wonder that Beelink has been &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/rsstafford/status/1946625692684243202&quot;&gt;selling&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/mitchellh/status/1943737627087450141&quot;&gt;these&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/matsonj/status/1947844912139145448&quot;&gt;units&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/codejake/status/1944972888161026425&quot;&gt;like&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/mani_bono/status/1940881681382244426&quot;&gt;hotcakes&lt;/a&gt; since I &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/dhh/status/1935500668992921731&quot;&gt;started&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/dhh/status/1941891417057685754&quot;&gt;talking&lt;/a&gt; about them on X as the ideal, cheap &lt;a href=&quot;https://omarchy.org&quot;&gt;Omarchy&lt;/a&gt; desktop computers. It&#39;s such a symbiotic relationship. There are a ton of programmers who have become Linux curious, and Beelink offers no-brainer options to give that a try at a bargain.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I just love when that happens. The perfect intersection of hardware, software, and timing. That&#39;s what we got here. It&#39;s a Beelink, baby!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(And no, before you ask, I don&#39;t get any royalties, there&#39;s no affiliate link, and I don&#39;t own any shares in Beelink. I just love discovering great technology and seeing people start their Linux journey with an awesome, affordable computer!)&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;div&gt;According to Statcounter, &lt;a href=&quot;https://ostechnix.com/linux-reaches-5-desktop-market-share-in-usa/&quot;&gt;Linux has claimed 5% market share of desktop computing in the US&lt;/a&gt;. That&#39;s double of where it was &lt;a href=&quot;https://gs.statcounter.com/os-market-share/desktop/united-states-of-america/#monthly-202207-202507&quot;&gt;just three years ago&lt;/a&gt;! Really impressive.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;Windows is still dominant at 63%, and Apple sit at 26%. But for the latter, it&#39;s quite a drop from their peak of 33% in June 2023.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;These are just browser stats, though (even if it&#39;s backed up by &lt;a href=&quot;https://radar.cloudflare.com/explorer?dataSet=http&amp;amp;groupBy=os&amp;amp;dt=52w&amp;amp;filters=deviceType%253DDesktop%252CbotClass%253DLikely_Human&amp;amp;loc=US&quot;&gt;directionally-similar numbers from Cloudflare&lt;/a&gt;). There&#39;s undoubtedly some variability in the numbers, by the season, and by what lives in the relatively large 4% mystery box of &quot;other&quot;. But there&#39;s no denying that Linux is trending in the right direction in the US.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;As a Dane, though, I find it sad that &lt;a href=&quot;https://gs.statcounter.com/os-market-share/desktop/denmark/#monthly-202001-202507&quot;&gt;Denmark is once again a laggard&lt;/a&gt; when it comes to adoption. Windows is even more dominant there at almost 70% (with Apple at 15%). Linux is just under 2%. Interestingly, though, ChromeOS, which is basically a locked-down Linux distribution, is at almost 5%.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I guess I really shouldn&#39;t be disappointed because this is how it always was. It was a big reason why I moved to the US back in 2005. When Ruby on Rails was taking off, it was in America first and foremost. Danish companies were too conservative, too complacent, too married to Microsoft to really pay attention.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are &lt;a href=&quot;https://world.hey.com/dhh/denmark-gets-more-serious-about-digital-sovereignty-7736f756&quot;&gt;early indications&lt;/a&gt; that a willingness to change this laggard mentality might be sprouting, but we&#39;ve yet to see any evidence that a shift has actually taken hold yet. It&#39;s hard to change culture!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;So while the Danes continue to fiddle, the Americans continue to push forward. Linux is on the up and up!&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;div&gt;I&#39;ve never seen so many developers curious about leaving the Mac and giving Linux a go. Something has really changed in the last few years. Maybe Linux just got better? Maybe &lt;a href=&quot;https://world.hey.com/dhh/cheap-mini-pcs-have-gotten-really-good-c70ab40f&quot;&gt;powerful mini PCs&lt;/a&gt; made it easier? Maybe Apple just fumbled their relationship with developers &lt;a href=&quot;https://mobilegamer.biz/apples-new-eu-app-store-rules-are-insane-intentionally-confusing-and-blatantly-unlawful-say-pundits/&quot;&gt;one too many times&lt;/a&gt;? Maybe it&#39;s all of it. But whatever the reason, the vibe shift is noticeable.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;This is why the future is so hard to predict! People have been joking about &quot;The Year of Linux on the Desktop&quot; since the late 90s. Just like self-driving cars were supposed to be a thing back in 2017. And now, in the year of our Lord 2025, it seems like &lt;a href=&quot;https://world.hey.com/dhh/self-driving-is-finally-happening-1d973fdd&quot;&gt;we&#39;re getting both&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I also wouldn&#39;t underestimate the cultural influence of a few key people. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVI_smLgTY0&quot;&gt;PewDiePie sharing his journey into Arch and Hyprland with his 110 million followers&lt;/a&gt; is important. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZH3iKbEiks0&quot;&gt;ThePrimeagen moving to Arch and Hyprland&lt;/a&gt; is important. Typecraft teaching beginners &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CP_9-jCV6A&quot;&gt;how to build an Arch and Hyprland setup from scratch&lt;/a&gt; is important (and who &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zikJTpJgzzo&quot;&gt;I just spoke to about Omarchy&lt;/a&gt;). Gabe Newell&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck&quot;&gt;Steam Deck&lt;/a&gt; being built on Arch and pushing Proton to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.protondb.com/explore?selectedFilters=whitelisted&quot;&gt;over 20,000 compatible Linux games&lt;/a&gt; is important.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;You&#39;ll notice a trend here, which is that &lt;a href=&quot;https://archlinux.org/&quot;&gt;Arch Linux&lt;/a&gt;, a notoriously &quot;difficult&quot; distribution, is at the center of much of this new engagement. Despite the fact that it&#39;s been around since 2003! There&#39;s nothing new about Arch, but there&#39;s something new about the circles of people it&#39;s engaging.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I&#39;ve put Arch at the center of &lt;a href=&quot;https://omarchy.org&quot;&gt;Omarchy&lt;/a&gt; too. Originally just because that was what &lt;a href=&quot;https://hypr.land/&quot;&gt;Hyprland&lt;/a&gt; recommended. Then, after living with the wonders of 90,000+ packages on the community-driven &lt;a href=&quot;https://aur.archlinux.org/&quot;&gt;AUR package repository&lt;/a&gt;, for its own sake. It&#39;s really good!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;But while Arch (and Hyprland) are having a moment amongst a new crowd, it&#39;s also &quot;just&quot; Linux at its core. And Linux really is the star of the show. The perfect, free, and open alternative that was just sitting around waiting for developers to finally have had enough of the commercial offerings from Apple and Microsoft.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now obviously there&#39;s a taste of &quot;new vegan sees vegans everywhere&quot; here. You start talking about Linux, and you&#39;ll hear from folks already in the community or those considering the move too. It&#39;s easy to confuse what you&#39;d like to be true with what is actually true.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;And it&#39;s definitely true that Linux is still a niche operating system on the desktop. Even among developers. Apple and Microsoft sit on the lion&#39;s share of the market share. But the mind share? They&#39;ve been losing that fast.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The window is open for a major shift to happen. First gradually, then suddenly. It feels like morning in Linux land!&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;div&gt;I still remember how the car industry got all excited back in 2017 about how steering wheels would soon be obsolete. Every concept car then was a living room on wheels, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TAoqHwRi9k&quot;&gt;seats facing inwards&lt;/a&gt;. The self-driving revolution was imminent, they said. Well, it wasn&#39;t... but now it actually is!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Humans have a hard time with scenarios like this. If you promise them the moon in eight months, but don&#39;t end up delivering until eight years later, most will justifiably be skeptical that it&#39;s actually here — even in the face of gushing anecdotes and video evidence. That&#39;s the problem with delayed promises.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;So when Jason told me Tesla&#39;s self-driving tech was finally ready and real, I was indeed skeptical. I tried FSD as late as last year, and I didn&#39;t enjoy it much. Impressive in many ways, but too jerky. Too many interventions. How much could it really have improved in nine months or so? A lot, it turns out.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;We started the drive from Jason&#39;s house, and I watched him not once touch the pedals or steering wheel while we drove half an hour to the other end of town. Then repeated the feat on the way back. But that wasn&#39;t even the most impressive part. What really blew my mind was how dramatically better the fluidity of driving with FSD has become.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;His new Model Y anticipated the red light with the manners of a drives-for-the-queen-level chauffeur. And the way it knew exactly how to slow down to prevent a jerky movement when taking an incline into an elevated parking lot? Sublime.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;Elon, that son of a bitch, seems to have done it again! Proven everyone wrong. Proven me wrong. The self-driving dream has flipped from vaporware to credible near-term reality. All without LiDAR. AI really delivering on this one.&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;div&gt;My latest love letter to Linux has been published. It&#39;s called &lt;a href=&quot;https://omarchy.org/&quot;&gt;Omarchy&lt;/a&gt;, and it&#39;s an opinionated setup of &lt;a href=&quot;https://archlinux.org/&quot;&gt;the Arch Linux distribution&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://hypr.land/&quot;&gt;the Hyprland tiling window manager&lt;/a&gt;. With everything configured out-of-the-box to give you exactly the same setup that I now run every day. My Platonic ideal of what a developer environment should look like.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;It&#39;s not for everyone, though. Arch has a reputation for being difficult, but while I think that&#39;s vastly overstated, I still think it&#39;s fair to say that Ubuntu is an easier landing for someone new to Linux. And that&#39;s why this exists as a sister project to &lt;a href=&quot;https://omakub.org&quot;&gt;Omakub&lt;/a&gt; — my opinionated setup for Ubuntu — and not a replacement of it.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;Because I do think that Hyprland deserves its reputation of being difficult! Not because the core tiling window manager is hard, but because it comes incredibly bare-boned in the box. You have to figure out everything yourself. Even how to get a lock screen or idle timing or a menu bar or bluetooth setting or... you get the idea.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Omarchy is an attempt to solve for all that. To give you a default set of great, beautiful configurations for Hyprland, and installing all the common tooling you&#39;d normally want. You could setup this, not change a thing, and you&#39;ll have exactly what I run every day.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;But you can also just use this as a paved path into the glorious world of Linux ricing. The flip side of Hyprland being so atomized is that it&#39;s infinitely configurable. You can really, really make it yours. No wonder its the preferred platform for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/&quot;&gt;r/unixporn&lt;/a&gt;, and even &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVI_smLgTY0&quot;&gt;what PewDiePie picked up&lt;/a&gt; for his amazing Russian nuclear core build.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;I don&#39;t know when we&#39;ll literally get &quot;The Year of Linux on the Desktop&quot;, but I&#39;ve never been as convinced that its coming as I am now. There&#39;s enough dissent in the water. Enough dissatisfaction with both Apple and Microsoft.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;And between Valve going all-in on Steam on Linux (the Steamdeck runs Arch!), major creators (like PewDiePie) switching to Linux, and incredible projects like Hyprland — which offer not just a cheap visual copy of the two major commercial operating systems, but something much more unique and compelling — I think all the factors are in place for a big switch. At least among developers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;But broad adoption or not, I&#39;m in love with Linux, and thrilled to share my work to make it easier to enjoy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-gallery attachment-gallery--2&quot;&gt;

  &lt;div&gt;The recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/article/icc-trump-sanctions-karim-khan-court-a4b4c02751ab84c09718b1b95cbd5db3&quot;&gt;disconnection of the ICC&#39;s chief prosecutor&lt;/a&gt;, at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/imposing-sanctions-on-the-international-criminal-court/&quot;&gt;the behest&lt;/a&gt; of the American administration, could not have come at a worse time for Microsoft. Just a month prior, the folks from Redmond &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2025/04/30/european-digital-commitments/&quot;&gt;tried to assure Europe&lt;/a&gt; that all was well. That any speculation Europeans could get cut off from critical digital infrastructure was just fear, doubt, and uncertainty. Then everything Europeans worried could happen happened in Hague. Oops!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Microsoft&#39;s assurances met reality and reality won.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;That reality is that all American administrations have the power to disconnect any individual, company, or foreign government from digital infrastructure provided by American Big Tech. So in that sense, it&#39;s pointless to blame Microsoft for the sanctioning power vested in the Oval Office. But we certainly can blame them for gaslighting Europe about the risk.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;What&#39;s more important than apportioning blame, though, is getting out of the bind that Europe is in. The continent is hopelessly dependent on American Big Tech for even the most basic of digital infrastructure. If this American administration, or the next, decides to use its sanctioning power again, Europe is in a real pickle. And with the actions taken against the ICC in Haag, Europe would be negligent to ignore the threat.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Denmark even more so. It&#39;s no secret that tensions between Denmark and the US are at a historic high. Trump keeps repeating &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newsweek.com/trump-greenland-denmark-mette-frederiksen-nato-russia-china-2077596&quot;&gt;a desire to take over Greenland&lt;/a&gt; by fuzzy means possible. The American intelligence services have been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/world/greenland-spying-us-intelligence-809c4ef2&quot;&gt;directed to increase their spying&lt;/a&gt; on Denmark and Greenland. Naturally, the Danes are spooked. They should be!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Regardless of what happens with Greenland, trade negotiations, or geopolitical disagreements, though, it would suit Europe well to become digitally sovereign. That doesn&#39;t mean cutting off all American tech, but it does mean rejecting any services that can be turned off from Washington. So in terms of Microsoft, it means no more Microsoft 365, no more Teams, no more Azure.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;And that&#39;s exactly what the two biggest counties in Denmark have announced plans to do. Copenhagen and Aarhus just declared that &lt;a href=&quot;https://politiken.dk/viden/tech/art10411353/Nu-er-det-nok-K%C3%B8benhavn-og-Aarhus-vil-g%C3%B8re-sig-uafh%C3%A6ngige-af-Microsoft?shareToken=tKwKubAE1XVA&quot;&gt;they&#39;re going to get rid of Microsoft products&lt;/a&gt; for all their workers. The Copenhagen county is the largest employer in Denmark with over 40,000 employees. So this is a big deal!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The chairman of the Copenhagen committee who pushed this forward made this comment to Danish media:&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;em&gt;If, theoretically, the relationship to the US gets worse, we could fear that Microsoft would be forced to shut everything down. That possibility exists. And if we suddenly can&#39;t access our emails or communicate via our systems, we&#39;ll be challenged.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;That&#39;s an understatement. Denmark is one of the most highly digitalized countries in the world. It&#39;s also one of the most Microsoft dependent. In fact, Microsoft is by far and away the single biggest dependency, so it makes perfect sense to start the quest for digital sovereignty there.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;But Denmark is also full of unambitious, defeatist bureaucrats who can&#39;t imagine a world without Microsoft. Just today, the IT director for The Capital Region &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.version2.dk/artikel/it-direktoer-tror-ikke-paa-microsoft-exit-det-er-utopi-danmark-kan-udvikle-alternativer&quot;&gt;declared it to utopian to think Denmark could ever achieve digital sovereignty or meaningfully replace Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;. Not even a decade would make a dent, says the director, while recognizing that if we&#39;d done something 15 years ago, we wouldn&#39;t be in this pickle. A remarkable illustration of cognitive dissonance!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sadly, this is not an uncommon conclusion from people who work inside the belly of bureaucracies for too long. Whatever has always done too often seems like the only thing that ever could be done. But, as Mandela said, it always seems impossible until it&#39;s done.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;So let&#39;s get it done. Digital sovereignty isn&#39;t easy, but neither was securing a sovereign energy supply. Nor will it be to rebuild a credible defensive military. Europe needs all of it, yesterday. The bureaucrats who aren&#39;t interested in making it happen should find employment elsewhere.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;div&gt;Over the years, I&#39;ve learned not to question inspiration. To simply let it drive when it shows up with a full tank. Quite often, I don&#39;t exactly know where we&#39;re going or even why we&#39;re going, but it&#39;s repeatedly taken me to just the right place at just the right time, so now I just hop in and say: Let&#39;s go!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;Case in point: &lt;a href=&quot;https://archlinux.org/&quot;&gt;Arch&lt;/a&gt; + &lt;a href=&quot;https://hyprland.org/&quot;&gt;Hyprland&lt;/a&gt;. It&#39;s been over a year since I created &lt;a href=&quot;https://omakub.org/&quot;&gt;Omakub&lt;/a&gt; to smooth out my own exit path from macOS to Linux, and in the process, helped thousands of others enjoy a beautiful, preconfigured, and relatively familiar desktop experience with Ubuntu. And I continue to think this is an excellent choice for Linux, especially for first-time Mac and Windows defectors.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;But this weekend, I just happened to be home alone, and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CP_9-jCV6A&quot;&gt;hype&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzUu77RZGSE&quot;&gt;around&lt;/a&gt; Arch + Hyprland got the better of me. While Ubuntu is all about being a friendly place for newcomers to Linux, Arch + Hyprland is the exact opposite: It&#39;s Linux on hard mode!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;At least that&#39;s the reputation, and there&#39;s certainly something to that. The Arch ISO literally just dumps you into a terminal with scarcely any direction. Just getting on the Wi-Fi requires learning the arcane command-line options for the iwctl terminal configurator.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;But besides iwctl, it&#39;s actually not that bad anymore. We now have a cheat code for installing Arch in the form of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9nKjTfDHLA&quot;&gt;archinstall&lt;/a&gt;. It&#39;s a terminal interface for getting all the bits like picking a disk and creating the first user done in the correct order, without having to set aside an entire evening just to get the OS installed. So it didn&#39;t take long to get Arch up and running.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;That doesn&#39;t get you much further, though! By default, Arch is about as minimal as it gets. There&#39;s no default graphical interface. There are no niceties. Not even wget or curl by default! It really is just a bare-bones installation of Linux.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;But on the other hand, Arch is blessed with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Arch_User_Repository&quot;&gt;AUR&lt;/a&gt; — a Wikipedia-style, community-maintained package management system that seems to have literally every piece of software ever released on Linux, and always in the latest version.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;A quarter of Omakub is trying to work around the fact that helpful tools like Alacritty or LazyGit or whatever rarely have official packages for Ubuntu, so you&#39;re left doing a lot of manual scripting to get everything a developer would want from a modern Linux setup. Not so with the AUR!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;So that&#39;s Arch. But Hyprland is even more hilarious. It&#39;s a tiling window manager with something as rare in the Linux world as a keen focus on aesthetics! It looks like it was written by visual artists rather than neckbeards. And it&#39;s at the core of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/top/?t=all&quot;&gt;the modern r/unixporn Linux ricing subculture&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;That&#39;s not the funny part, though. The funny part is how ridiculously atomized the entire thing is. Hyprland comes with absolutely nothing out of the box. No login screen, no menu bar, no notification system, no file manager, no visual settings application. Just a text-based configuration file, a wiki, and an outline on a map for how to design your own adventure.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;This means that if you&#39;re interested in running Hyprland, and you intend to set it all up from scratch, you&#39;re probably signing up for at least a good 10+ hours — just to install and configure everything! Now, there are some precompiled setup scripts out there already, but most of them still require you to do a ton of manual legwork before you reach that beautiful summit of a complete system.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;So while the downside of Arch + Hyprland is that literally every last detail requires you to make a choice and a config file to move on, it&#39;s also its upside: you can change EVERYTHING! And the core window tiling magic of Hyprland is one of the most intoxicating ways of using a computer that I&#39;ve ever experienced. It looks amazing; it feels amazing (if you prefer using a keyboard instead of a mouse!).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&#39;ve poured hours and hours into this quest over the weekend, and yet I&#39;m still not even done with my first Arch + Hyprland build! My login screen looks like shit. I haven&#39;t decided on a final menu bar configuration. But what is working — the basic tiling flow and look — is so nice that the inspiration keeps driving the project forward.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Which, of course, I&#39;ve already decided to codify. I&#39;m not going through all this work to set up a beautiful, preconfigured, fully-functional, out-of-the-box Arch + Hyprland combo and then not share it with anyone who&#39;s curious (and might not have 10–20 hours for this kind of side quest available in their schedule). So of course I registered a domain and found a way to draw some ASCII art: &lt;a href=&quot;https://omarchy.org&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Omarchy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is on the way!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &lt;figure class=&quot;attachment attachment--preview attachment--lightboxable attachment--png&quot;&gt;

  &lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hey.com/apple/&quot;&gt;Our battle with Apple&lt;/a&gt; over &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/dhh/status/1272968382329942017&quot;&gt;their gangster attempt&lt;/a&gt; to extort 30% of our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hey.com/&quot;&gt;HEY&lt;/a&gt; revenues was one of the defining moments of my career. It was the kind of test that calls you to account for what you believe and asks what you&#39;re willing to risk to see it through. Well, we risked everything, but also &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hey.com/apple/path/&quot;&gt;secured a four-year truce&lt;/a&gt;, and now &lt;a href=&quot;https://9to5mac.com/2025/05/01/epic-win-apple-link-out-to-web-free-reign/&quot;&gt;near-total victory&lt;/a&gt; is at hand: &lt;a href=&quot;https://apps.apple.com/us/app/hey-email/id1506603805&quot;&gt;HEY is finally for sale on the iPhone in the US!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;Credit for this amazing turn of events goes to Epic Games founders &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic&quot;&gt;Tim Sweeney&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/MarkRein&quot;&gt;Mark Rein&lt;/a&gt;, who did what no small developer like us could ever dream of doing: they &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/06/epic-games-legal-fees/&quot;&gt;spent over $100 million to sue Apple&lt;/a&gt; in court. And while the first round yielded very little progress, Apple&#39;s (&lt;a href=&quot;https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/legaldocs/zjpqagqoypx/Epic%20v%20Apple%20-%20referral%20order%20-%20Gonzalez%20Rogers%2020250430.pdf&quot;&gt;possibly criminal&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/us-judge-rules-apple-violated-order-reform-app-store-2025-04-30/&quot;&gt;contempt of court&lt;/a&gt; is what ultimately &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/30/apple-app-store-anti-steering-injunction-violation/&quot;&gt;delivered the resolution&lt;/a&gt;. Thanks to their fight for Fortnite, app developers everywhere are now allowed to link out of apps to their own web-based payment system in the US store (but, sadly, nowhere else yet).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;This is all we ever wanted from Apple: to have a way to distribute our iPhone apps and keep the customer relationship by billing directly. The 30% toll gets all the attention, and it is ludicrously egregious, but to us, it&#39;s just as much about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hey.com/apple/iap/&quot;&gt;retaining that direct customer relationship&lt;/a&gt;, so we can help folks with refunds, so they don&#39;t tie their billing for a multi-platform email system to a single manufacturer.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;Apple always claims to put the needs of the users first, and that whatever hardship developers have to carry is justified by their customer-focused obsession. But in this case, it&#39;s clear that the obsession was with collecting the easiest billions Apple has ever made, by taking an obscene cut of all software and subscription sales on the platform.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;This obsession with squeezing every last dollar from developers has produced countless customer-hostile experiences on the iPhone. Like how you couldn&#39;t buy a book in the Kindle app before this (now you can!). Or sign up for a Netflix subscription (now you can!). Before, users would hunt in vain for an explanation inside these apps, and thanks to Apple&#39;s gag orders, developers were not even allowed to explain the confusing situation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;It&#39;s been the same deal with HEY. While we successfully fought off Apple&#39;s attempt to extort us into using their in-app payment system (IAP), we&#39;ve been stuck with an awkward user experience ever since. One that prevented new customers from signing up for a real email address in the application, and instead sent them down this bizarre burner-account setup. All so the app would &quot;do something&quot;, in order to please an argument that App Store chief &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/18/interview-apples-schiller-says-position-on-hey-app-is-unchanged-and-no-rules-changes-are-imminent/?utm_source=chatgpt.com&quot;&gt;Phil Schiller made up on the fly in an interview&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;That&#39;s what we can now get rid of. No more weird burner accounts. Now you can sign up directly for a real email address in HEY, and if you like what we have to offer (and I think you will!), you&#39;ll be able to pay the $99/year for a subscription via a web-based flow that it&#39;s now kosher to link to from the app itself.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;What a journey, and what a needless torching of the developer relationship from Apple&#39;s side. We&#39;ve always been happy to pay Apple for hosting our application on the App Store, as all developers have always needed to do via the $99/year developer fee. But being forced to hand over 30% of the business, as well as the direct customer relationship, was always an unacceptable overreach.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Now that&#39;s been arrested by Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers from the United States District Court of Northern California, who has delivered app developers the only real relief that we&#39;ve seen in this whole sordid monopoly affair that&#39;s been boiling since 2020. It&#39;s a beautiful thing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;It also offers Apple an opportunity to bury the hatchet with developers. They can choose to accept the court&#39;s decision in full and worldwide. Allow developers everywhere the right to link to their own billing flow, so they can retain their own customer relationship, and so business models that can&#39;t carry a 30% toll can flourish.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;Besides, Apple&#39;s own offering will likely still have plenty of pull. I&#39;m sure many small developers would continue to consider IAP to avoid having to worry about international taxes or even direct customer service. Nobody is taking that away from Apple or those developers. All Judge Rogers is demanding is that Apple compete fairly with alternative arrangements.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;In case Apple doesn&#39;t accept the court&#39;s decision — and there&#39;s sadly &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1924499498513862720/photo/1&quot;&gt;some evidence&lt;/a&gt; to that — I hope the European antitrust regulators watch the simple yet powerful mechanism that Judge Rogers has imposed on Apple. While I&#39;d love side loading as much as the next sovereign techie who wants to own the hardware I buy, I think we can get the lion&#39;s share of independence by simply being allowed to link out of the apps, just like has been so ordered by this District Court.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I do hope, though, that Apple does accept the court&#39;s decision. Both because it would be a stain on their reputation to get convicted of criminal contempt of court, but also because I really want Apple to return to being a shining city on the hill. To show that you can win in the market merely by making better products. Something Apple never used to be afraid of doing. That they don&#39;t need these gangster extortion techniques to make the numbers that Cook has promised Wall Street.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;Despite &lt;a href=&quot;https://world.hey.com/dhh/the-year-on-linux-7f30279e&quot;&gt;moving on to Linux&lt;/a&gt; and Android, I have a real soft spot for Apple&#39;s taste, aesthetics, and engineering prowess. They&#39;ve lost their way and moral compass over the last half decade or so, but that&#39;s only one leadership pivot away from being found again. That won&#39;t win back all the trust and good faith that was squandered right away, but they&#39;ll at least be on the long road to recovery.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Who knows, maybe developers would even be inclined to assist Apple next time they &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/21/apples-vision-pro-has-a-problem-a-year-into-existence-too-few-apps.html&quot;&gt;need help launching a new device&lt;/a&gt; in need of third-party software to succeed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;attachment-gallery attachment-gallery--3&quot;&gt;

    <published>2025-05-18T08:32:35Z</published>
    <summary>&lt;div class=&quot;trix-content&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;For the past week, I&#39;ve been working off the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.minisforum.com/products/minisforum-um680-um760-um870-slim?variant=49516307939634&quot;&gt;Minisforum UM870&lt;/a&gt;. A tiny mini PC with an 8-core/16-thread AMD 8745H CPU, which retails for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/MINISFORUM-Barebone-Computer-5-0GHz-Support/dp/B0DL5ZRQV3/&quot;&gt;$343&lt;/a&gt; (or &lt;a href=&quot;https://minisforumpc.eu/products/um680-760-870-slim-mini-pc?variant=51700059144558&quot;&gt;€379&lt;/a&gt;) as a bare-bone unit, and stays below $550, even after adding &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Crucial-5600MT-5200MT-4800MT-CT48G56C46S5/dp/B0C79LKJK4/&quot;&gt;48GB of RAM&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/WD_BLACK-SN850X-Internal-Gaming-Solid/dp/B0B7CKVCCV/&quot;&gt;1TB of storage&lt;/a&gt;. I&#39;m shocked to report that I really don&#39;t need more than this!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;I mean, I knew that Apple&#39;s Mac Mini, which is equally petite to the Minisforum, had plenty of power for macOS. But somehow I thought Apple had some special sauce that made this possible, and that PCs were forever condemned to be bigger, louder, and slower. How 2020 of me.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;The UM870 is a little beast. It runs our full HEY test suite in just 2m28s. In comparison, it takes a 14-core M4 Pro 2m49s, and such &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/mac-mini/apple-m4-pro-chip-with-12-core-cpu-16-core-gpu-24gb-memory-512gb&quot;&gt;an Apple costs $2,199&lt;/a&gt;, once you&#39;ve given it 48GB of RAM and 1TB of storage.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, that M4 Mac Mini can probably do things with, say, 8K video editing that the UM870 can&#39;t touch. But on the other hand, the UM870 can &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKD2mU6shdo&amp;amp;t=269s&quot;&gt;play the latest video games&lt;/a&gt;. Everything from Fortnite to Cyberpunk 2077 to Forza Horizon. It won&#39;t trouble a modern, dedicated Nvidia card for max FPS, but it&#39;s perfectly playable at 1080p at medium settings in a ton of games.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;In raw CPU power, the AMD 8745H will match a regular M4 in multi-core. They both clock in right around 13,000 points on Geekbench 6. Though the M4 is a fair bit quicker in single-core. The AMD is also far behind an M4 Pro in raw multi-core power (13K vs 22K), but at less than a quarter the cost, it&#39;s hard to complain.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;But as with the example of video games, it&#39;s often deceiving just to compare the Geekbench numbers, because it all depends on what you&#39;re doing. If you&#39;re really into video games, it&#39;s no use to have extra grunt, if your favorite games won&#39;t run. The same is true if you&#39;re a developer working with Docker containers and a Linux toolchain. As quoted above, the UM870 handily defeats the M4 Pro in our all-cores-buzzing HEY test suite.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;That&#39;s partly because we run databases and accessories, like MySQL, Redis, and ElasticSearch, in Docker containers. Even though we run the Ruby code natively on both platforms, the Docker dependencies put the Mac further behind than it otherwise would have been, because Linux runs Docker natively, and the Mac has to deal with the file-system tax and other drawbacks.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;The irony is that it was partly Apple&#39;s volume with and investment in TSMC that got us these incredible AMD chips, as they&#39;re riding the same improvements in TSMC manufacturing prowess as Apple&#39;s M chips. The Zen 4 cores in the 8745H are all forged on the same 5nm process as the M2, so it&#39;s no surprise that the AMD cores are dead-on-the-money for Apple&#39;s in Geekbench single-core performance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;And Zen 4 is even the last generation! The insane new (and insanely named) AMD Ryzen AI Max 395+ chip that&#39;s used in the upcoming &lt;a href=&quot;https://frame.work/desktop&quot;&gt;Framework Desktop&lt;/a&gt; runs on Zen 5 cores. And with 16 of those, the 395+ is faster in Geekbench multi-core than an M4 Pro, and only ever so slightly behind the M4 Max. On my HEY test suite, it completes the run in an insane 1m21s — more than twice as fast as the 14-core M4 Pro!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;But I digress. The 395+ chip isn&#39;t cheap, even if it&#39;s still a great deal. The Framework Desktop with 64GB/1TB, which is twice as fast as the M4 Pro with our HEY tests, is $1,744. That&#39;s still less than the $2,199 Mac Mini, which only has 48GB of RAM. But obviously way more than a $550 Minisforum! And while it&#39;s quite small, it&#39;s not tiny, like the UM870.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;Regardless, this is what I love about technology. I love when our assumptions are tested: just how small and cheap can an awesome developer machine become? I love that open-source Linux is able to run laps around Apple in the workloads that many developers need (like working with Docker containers). I love that this tiny little silent $550 mini PC on my desk is capable of putting out computing power that only a decade ago would have been reserved to loud, honking metal in a data center.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Mini PCs have gotten really good. &lt;a href=&quot;https://world.hey.com/dhh/amd-in-everything-0ec0cc6e&quot;&gt;AMD is on a roll&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://world.hey.com/dhh/the-year-on-linux-7f30279e&quot;&gt;Linux is a blast&lt;/a&gt;. These are my conclusions. Check out the &lt;a href=&quot;https://store.minisforum.com/products/minisforum-um760-slim?variant=46040999624949&quot;&gt;Minisforum UM870&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bee-link.com/products/beelink-ser8-8745hs&quot;&gt;Beelink SER8&lt;/a&gt;. Anything with an AMD 7745H and up to an 8945HS should be a great deal. If you want to splurge (yet still get a bargain compared to the macs), you could have a look at the new HX370 in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bee-link.com/products/beelink-ser9-ai-9-hx-370&quot;&gt;Beelink SER9&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://store.minisforum.com/products/minisforum-ai-x1?variant=46484114014453&quot;&gt;Minisforum X1&lt;/a&gt;, but I&#39;d save my money, buy a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lofree.co/products/lofree-flow-the-smoothest-mechanical-keyboard&quot;&gt;Lofree Flow84&lt;/a&gt; keyboard to go with the new mini rig, and put the rest of the money towards a &lt;a href=&quot;https://world.hey.com/dhh/what-is-hifi-dddab2ae&quot;&gt;KEF LSX II savings fund&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update: The MediaTek Wifi + Bluetooth card used in the UM870 isn&#39;t compatible with Ubuntu out of the box. I run everything hardwired for performance, so didn&#39;t notice during my testing, but a reader caught it, and I confirmed it. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you need wireless out-of-the-box on Ubuntu, I found that the card in the Beelink SER9 works great with both. If you already have a UM870 or still want one, and you need wireless, you could buy the AMD RZ616 Wi-Fi 6E card &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://frame.work/products/amd-rz616-wi-fi-6e?v=FRANRFFX01&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;from Framework&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; or &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/OKN-AX210NGW-Bluetooth-Wireless-Ultra-Low/dp/B08MJLPZPL/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amazon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; for around $20 — that works and slots right in.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <summary>&lt;div class=&quot;trix-content&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;The appeal of &quot;vibe coding&quot; — where programmers lean back and prompt their way through an entire project with AI — appears partly to be based on the fact that so many development environments are deeply unpleasant to work with.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;So it&#39;s no wonder that all these programmers stuck working with cumbersome languages and frameworks can&#39;t wait to give up on the coding part of software development. If I found writing code a chore, I&#39;d be looking for retirement too.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;But I don&#39;t.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I mean, I used to! When I started programming, it was purely because I wanted programs. Learning to code was a necessary but inconvenient step toward bringing systems to life. That all changed when I learned Ruby and built Rails.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ruby&#39;s entire premise is &quot;programmer happiness&quot;: that writing code should be a joy. And historically, the language was willing to trade run-time performance, memory usage, and other machine sympathies against the pursuit of said programmer happiness. These days, it seems like you can eat your cake and have it too, though. Ruby, after thirty years of constant improvement, is now incredibly fast and efficient, yet remains a delight to work with.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;That ethos couldn&#39;t shine brighter now. Disgruntled programmers have finally realized that an escape from nasty syntax, boilerplate galore, and ecosystem hyper-churn is possible. That&#39;s the appeal of AI: having it hide away all that unpleasantness. Only it&#39;s like cleaning your room by stuffing the mess under the bed — it doesn&#39;t make it go away!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;But the instinct is correct: Programming &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be a vibe! It should be fun! It should resemble English closely enough that line noise doesn&#39;t obscure the underlying ideas and decisions. It should allow a richness of expression that serves the human reader instead of favoring the strictness preferred by the computer. Ruby does.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;And given that, I have no interest in giving up writing code. That&#39;s not the unpleasant part that I want AI to take off my hands. Just so I can — what? — become a project manager for a murder of AI crows? I&#39;ve had the option to retreat up the manager ladder for most of my career, but I&#39;ve steadily refused, because I really like writing Ruby! It&#39;s the most enjoyable part of the job!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;That doesn&#39;t mean AI doesn&#39;t have a role to play when writing Ruby. I&#39;m conversing and collaborating with LLMs all day long — looking up APIs, clarifying concepts, and asking stupid questions. AI is a superb pair programmer, but I&#39;d retire before permanently handing it the keyboard to drive the code.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Maybe one day, wanting to write code will be a quaint concept. Like tending to horses for transportation in the modern world — done as a hobby but devoid of any economic value.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I don&#39;t think anyone knows just how far we can push the intelligence and creativity of these insatiable token munchers. And I wouldn&#39;t bet against their advance, but it&#39;s clear to me that a big part of their appeal to programmers is the wisdom that Ruby was founded on: Programming should favor and flatter the human.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;div&gt;The web will be far worse off &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.msn.com/en-us/technology/tech-companies/a-judge-could-force-google-to-sell-chrome-what-you-need-to-know/ar-AA1DjlGy&quot;&gt;if Google is forced to sell Chrome&lt;/a&gt;, even if it&#39;s to atone for legitimate ad-market monopoly abuses. Which mean we&#39;ll all be worse off as the web would lose ground to actual monopoly platforms, like the iOS App Store and Google&#39;s own Play Store. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;First, Chrome won the browser war fair and square by building a better surfboard for the internet. This wasn&#39;t some opportune acquisition. This was the result of grand investments, great technical prowess, and markets doing what they&#39;re supposed to do: rewarding the best. Besides, we have a million alternatives. Firefox still exists, so does Safari,&amp;nbsp; so does the billion Chromium-based browsers like Brave and Edge. And we finally even have new engines on the way with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://ladybird.org/&quot;&gt;Ladybird browser&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Look, Google&#39;s trillion-dollar business depends on a thriving web that can be searched by Google.com, that can be plastered in AdSense, and that now can feed the wisdom of AI. Thus, Google&#39;s incredible work to further the web isn&#39;t an act of charity, it&#39;s of economic self-interest, and that&#39;s why it works. Capitalism &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/68664-it-is-not-from-the-benevolence-of-the-butcher-the&quot;&gt;doesn&#39;t run on benevolence&lt;/a&gt;, but incentives.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;We want an 800-pound gorilla in the web&#39;s corner! Because Apple would love nothing better (despite the admirable work to keep up with Chrome by Team Safari) to see the web&#39;s capacity as an application platform diminished. As would every other owner of a proprietary application platform. Microsoft fought the web tooth and nail back in the 90s because they knew that a free, open application platform would undermine lock-in — and it did!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;But the vitality of that free and open application platform depends on constant development. If the web stagnates, other platforms will gain. But with Team Chrome pushing the web forward in a million ways — be it import maps, nested CSS, web push, etc. — is therefore essential.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is a classic wealth vs. riches mistake. Lawyers see Chrome as valuable in a moment&#39;s snapshot, but the value is all in the wealth that continued investment brings. A Chrome left to languish with half the investment will evaporate as quickly as a lottery winner&#39;s riches. Wealth requires maintenance to endure.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;Google should not get away with rigging the online ad market, but forcing it to sell Chrome will do great damage to the web.&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;div&gt;We received over 2,200 applications for our &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/dhh/status/1909312757058482443&quot;&gt;just-closed junior programmer opening&lt;/a&gt;, and now we&#39;re going through all of them by hand and by human. No AI screening here. It&#39;s a lot of work, but we have a great team who take the work seriously, so in a few weeks, we&#39;ll be able to invite a group of finalists to the next phase.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;This highlights the folly of thinking that what it&#39;ll take to land a job like this is some specific list of criteria, though. Yes, you have to present a baseline of relevant markers to even get into consideration, like a great cover letter that doesn&#39;t smell like AI slop, promising projects or work experience or educational background, etc. But to actually get the job, you have to be the best of the ones who&#39;ve applied!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;It sounds self-evident, maybe, but I see questions time and again about it, so it must not be. Almost every job opening is grading applicants on the curve of everyone who has applied. And the best candidate of the lot gets the job. You can&#39;t quantify what that looks like in advance.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I&#39;m excited to see who makes it to the final stage. I already hear early whispers that we got some exceptional applicants in this round. It would be great to help counter the narrative that this industry no longer needs juniors. That&#39;s simply retarded.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;However good AI gets, we&#39;re always going to need people who know the ins and outs of what the machine comes up with. Maybe not as many, maybe not in the same roles, but it&#39;s truly utopian thinking that mankind won&#39;t need people capable of vetting the work done by AI in five minutes.&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;div&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://frame.work/products/laptop13-diy-amd-ai300/configuration/new&quot;&gt;new AMD HX370 option&lt;/a&gt; in the Framework 13 is a good step forward in performance for developers. It runs our HEY test suite in 2m7s, compared to 2m43s for the 7840U (and 2m49s for a M4 Pro!). It&#39;s also about 20% faster in most single-core tasks than the 7840U.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;But is that enough to warrant the jump in price? AMD&#39;s latest, best chips have suddenly gotten pretty expensive. The F13 w/ HX370 now costs $1,992 with 32GB RAM / 1TB. Almost the same an M4 Pro MBP14 w/ 24GB / 1TB ($2,199). I&#39;d pick the Framework any day for its better keyboard, 3:2 matte screen, repairability, and superb Linux compatibility, but it won&#39;t be because the top option is &quot;cheaper&quot; any more.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;Of course you could also just go with the budget 6-core Ryzen AI 5 340 in same spec for $1,362. I&#39;m sure that&#39;s a great machine too. But maybe the sweet spot is actually the Ryzen AI 7 350. It &quot;only&quot; has 8 cores (vs 12 on the 370), but four of those are performance cores -- the same as the 370. And it&#39;s $300 cheaper. So ~$1,600 gets you out the door. I haven&#39;t actually tried the 350, though, so that&#39;s just speculation. I&#39;ve been running the 370 for the last few months.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Whichever chip you choose, the rest of the Framework 13 package is as good as it ever was. This remains my favorite laptop of at least the last decade. I&#39;ve been &lt;a href=&quot;https://world.hey.com/dhh/the-year-on-linux-7f30279e&quot;&gt;running one for over a year now&lt;/a&gt;, and combined with &lt;a href=&quot;https://omakub.org/&quot;&gt;Omakub&lt;/a&gt; + &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4OyfL5o7DU&quot;&gt;Neovim&lt;/a&gt;, it&#39;s the first machine in forever where I&#39;ve actually enjoyed programming on a 13&quot; screen. The 3:2 aspect ratio combined with Linux&#39;s superb multiple desktops that switch with 0ms lag and no animations means I barely miss the trusted 6K Apple XDR screen when working away from the desk.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The HX370 gives me about 6 hours of battery life in mixed use. About the same as the old 7840U. Though if all I&#39;m doing is writing, I can squeeze that to 8-10 hours. That&#39;s good enough for me, but not as good as a Qualcomm machine or an Apple M-chip machine. For some people, those extra hours really make the difference.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;What does make a difference, of course, is Linux. I&#39;ve written repeatedly about how much of a joy it&#39;s been to rediscover Linux on the desktop, and it&#39;s a joy that keeps on giving. For web work, it&#39;s so good. And for any work that requires even a minimum of Docker, it&#39;s so fast (as the HEY suite run time attests).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;Apple still has a strong hardware game, but their software story is falling apart. I haven&#39;t heard many people sing the praises of new iOS or macOS releases in a long while. It seems like &lt;a href=&quot;https://world.hey.com/dhh/apple-needs-a-new-asshole-in-charge-0bf46b94&quot;&gt;without an asshole in charge&lt;/a&gt;, both have move towards more bloat, more ads, more gimmicks, more control. Linux is an incredible antidote to this nonsense these days.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;It&#39;s also just fun! Seeing &lt;a href=&quot;https://world.hey.com/dhh/amd-in-everything-0ec0cc6e&quot;&gt;AMD catch up in outright performance&lt;/a&gt; if not efficiency has been a delight. Watching Framework perfect their 13&quot; laptop while remaining 100% backwards compatible in terms of upgrades with the first versions is heartwarming. And getting to test the new &lt;a href=&quot;https://frame.work/desktop&quot;&gt;Framework Desktop&lt;/a&gt; in advance of its Q3 release has only affirmed my commitment to both.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;But on the new HX370, it&#39;s in my opinion the best Linux laptop you can buy today, which by extension makes it the best web developer laptop too. The top spec might have gotten a bit pricey, but there are options all along the budget spectrum, which retains all the key ingredients any way. Hard to go wrong.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;Forza Framework!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
